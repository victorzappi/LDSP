# README

## What’s Ne10?
Ne10 is a library of common, useful functions that have been heavily optimised for ARM-based CPUs equipped with [NEON](https://www.arm.com/products/processors/technologies/neon.php) SIMD capabilities. It provides consistent, well-tested behaviour, allowing for painless integration into a wide variety of applications. The library currently focuses primarily around math, signal processing, image processing, and physics functions.

## Building [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/projectNe10/Ne10.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/projectNe10/Ne10)
Out of the box, Ne10 supports the Linux, Android, and iOS platforms. For instructions on building Ne10 for these platforms, please consult the build instructions in [`building.md`](https://github.com/projectNe10/Ne10/tree/master/doc/building.md#building-ne10). It is possible to use the library on other platforms (or, indeed, “without a platform”), however you may have to fiddle with some of the build configuration files.

Once Ne10 has been built, it can be linked against just like any other C library. To link C code against Ne10, for instance, the compiler must first be aware of Ne10's library and header files — those within `build/modules/` and `inc/`. To do this, these files can be copied to the standard directories used by compilation tools by running `make install`, or by installing Ne10 from a package manager. Following this, you can simply include `Ne10.h` in your C code, and ask the compiler to link against the `NE10` library (e.g. with `-lNE10`).

## Documentation
Ne10’s official documentation is generated from [doxygen](https://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) annotations in the source code. As such, these documents can be generated locally from the codebase by running `doxygen` within the `doc` directory (producing results in `doc/html`), or viewed remotely as [hosted copies available over the Internet](http://projectne10.github.io/Ne10/doc/modules.html).

We also have a handful of carefully prepared sample code snippets in the [`samples/`](https://github.com/projectNe10/Ne10/tree/master/samples) directory that outline how Ne10 can be used to accomplish a number of common tasks. These include example programs to perform the [FFT](https://github.com/projectNe10/Ne10/tree/master/samples/NE10_sample_complex_fft.c), [FIR](https://github.com/projectNe10/Ne10/tree/master/samples/NE10_sample_fir.c), and [matrix multiply](https://github.com/projectNe10/Ne10/tree/master/samples/NE10_sample_matrix_multiply.c) operations.

## Contributing
Ne10 welcomes and encourages external contributions of any and all forms. If you’ve found a bug or have a suggestion, please don’t hesitate to detail these in the [official issue tracker](https://github.com/projectNe10/Ne10/issues). For those looking to get their hands dirty and contribute code (the best kind of contribution!), please see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/projectNe10/Ne10/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-to-project-ne10) for more details.
