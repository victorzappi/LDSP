Tested on LineageOS 21 [Android 14]
but built for Android 13 with NDK 25 [max is Android 13]

Every time an LDSP application is launched, Android is uncapable of setting the speaker correctly
and the output is distorted. Reboot needed


Flashlight does not work. It works manually ONCE when controlling 'switch 0'
Vibration does not work. Probably needs both 'activate' and 'duration'
LED could not be configured
