# INTRODUCTION
## BEFORE YOU START!
Your Android Phone needs to be **rooted**. This process highly depends on the specific brand and model of your phone, and may take from 5 minutes to several days. The XDA forum is the best place to look for guides/how-tos and get help:
[https://forum.xda-developers.com/](https://forum.xda-developers.com/)

Then, make sure that you have *Developer Options* enabled on the phone and inside that manu activate *USB debugging*.

### Will It Work With My Phone?
Rooting is the first step! Every model needs to be accompanied by a custom made configuraton file to be truly hacked and support LDSP. Although it is theoretically possible to hack all Android phones and run LDSP on them, some models and vendors are way more difficult to deal with than others.
More on this stuff is explained in one of the later doc pages ([Phone Configuration](3_phone_config.md)).

**Here is a list of the phones we tested**:
- Asus ZenFone 2 Laser (ZE500KL - Z00ED)
- Asus ZenFone Go (ZB500KG - X00BD)
- Huawei P8 Lite (alice)
- Huawei P10 Lite (WAS-LX1A)
- LG G2 Mini (g2m)
- LG Nexus 4 (mako)
- LG Nexus 5 (bullhead)
- Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 (SM-T237P)
- Xiaomi Mi8 Lite (platina)

Each comes with a pre-made configuration file, stored in [LDSP/phones](../LDSP/phones) and orgnaized by vendor.
If you configure a new phone, please let us know and we will add the configuration file you created for it!
